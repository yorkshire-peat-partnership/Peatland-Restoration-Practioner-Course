## Digitising Basics

### Introduction

This tutorial will show you how to use QGIS to digitise features as well as best practices to ensure the features are accurately drawn.

#### What is Digitising?

Digitising is a term used in GIS for creating a vector data set that represents a real world feature. Vector data-sets are useful in that they allow the computer to easily calculate geometric attributes such as area or length.

#### Creating a Layer

Ordinarily, layers will already be created for you ready for digitising.

In this tutorial, however, we will create a **Temporary Scratch Layer** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCreateMemory.svg) for practicing.

In QGIS, navigate to **Layer \> Create Layer \> New Temporary Scratch Layer...** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCreateMemory.svg)

Change the **Layer name** and the **Geometry type** to the type of layer you would like to create.

#### Adding Features {#sec-adding-features}

To begin digitising, click once on the layer you want to edit from the **Layer Panel**. A blue layer means it is selected.

Click on the yellow pencil ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionToggleEditing.svg) on the **Digitising Panel** to **Toggle Digitising Mode**.

![](/assets/t-digitise-peatlands-digitise-panel.png){fig-align="center"}

Once you are in digitising mode, the **Add Feature** icon will become available. Depending on the geometry type of the temporary vector layer you have created, this will look slightly different.

|                                            Add Feature Icon                                             | Layer geometry type         |
|:---------------------------------------------------:|-------------------|
|  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCapturePoint.svg)  | Point, MultiPoint           |
|  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCaptureLine.svg)   | LineString, MultiLineString |
| ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCapturePolygon.svg) | Polygon, MultiPolygon       |

To digitise, left click to place a node. Move the mouse and left click again to add another node.

If you have made a mistake, press **Backspace** to remove the previous node.

Once you have finished the feature, right click to complete the geometry.

**Save Layer Edits** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionSaveAllEdits.svg) to commit the changes to the data source.

:::

##### Snapping

The QGIS Snapping tool can be used to create features that connect to each other, to increase the accuracy of edits.

To turn on snapping, navigate to **Project \> Snapping Options... \> Enable Snapping (S)** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mIconSnapping.svg)

Turn on **All Layers** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mIconSnappingAllLayers.svg), **Vertex** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mIconSnappingVertex.svg).

Click on the yellow pencil ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionToggleEditing.svg) on the **Digitising Panel** to **Toggle Digitising Mode**.

Hover over the vertices of the layer you would like to snap to. It should show a purple box.

Left click to begin snapping and adding to the **Temporary Scratch Layer** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCreateMemory.svg).

![](/assets/t-digitising-03.gif){fig-align="center"}

##### Tracing {#sec-tracing}

Accurately matching features such as site boundaries can be challenging.

It is tedious and time consuming to make sure you snap to every point on a feature and inevitably, you may end up with something looking like this:

![](/assets/t-tips-tracing-01.png)

As you can see, there are a lot of gaps and the overlap between features are called 'slivers'.

::: callout-important
Gaps and slivers must be avoided, as this may result in implications for calculating areas correctly.
:::

QGIS provides an excellent tracing tool which automatically snaps along the shortest path, ensuring that there are no overlaps or gaps.

Select **Enable** **Snapping (S)**![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mIconSnapping.svg), click on **Open Snapping Options** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mIconSnappingAllLayers.svg)and navigate to **Advanced Configuration** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mIconSnappingAdvanced.svg) in the **Project Snapping Settings** to turn snapping on for your desired layer.

![](/assets/t-tips-tracing-04.PNG){fig-align="center"}

Select the **Enable Tracing (T)** tool ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionTracing.svg), **Toggle Editing** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionToggleEditing.svg) and select the **Add Polygon Feature (Ctrl+.)** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/mActionCapturePolygon.svg) to begin tracing the site boundary.

![](/assets/t-tips-tracing-03.gif){fig-align="center" width="683"}

Now you should have topologically correct boundaries:

## Extracting data from QGIS

### Installing GroupStats Plugin

Ensure the GroupStats Plugin has been installed using the **Plugins manager** in QGIS.

![](/assets/t-groupstats-01.png)

If it has not been installed, please follow the [guide to installing plugins](#sec-plugins).

:::{.column-page}
![](/assets/Groupstats installation.gif)
:::

## Using the GroupStats Plugin

Once the plugin has installed, you can open it by navigating to **Vector \> Group Stats.**

Here is an example dataset which contains all the grips, gullies, and hags for a site, along with their categories:

![](/assets/t-groupstats-02.png)

The plugin works by dragging and dropping certain fields into the **Column, Row** and **Value** boxes on the **GroupStats** window. The large box on the left-hand side will display the results of your calculation.

::: callout-tip
If you are familiar with [Excel Pivot Tables](https://www.howtogeek.com/701536/how-to-use-pivot-tables-to-analyze-excel-data/), the principle is the same.
:::

You must first select the layer you are would like to analyse on the **Layers** drop down which will populate the **Fields** box.

The **Rows** or **Column** box is where you put the field you want to group by. The **Value** box takes two parameters - the value you want to aggregate, and the aggregation function.

In this example, the value to be aggregated is **Length**, using the aggregation function **Sum**.

![](/assets/t-groupstats-03.png)

::: callout-note
You can group the data by multiple fields, in the **Rows** or **Columns** boxes
:::

Once you have setup the inputs to the GroupStats calculation, click **Calculate** to see the result:
