    "text": "Digitising Basics\n\nIntroduction\nThis tutorial will show you how to use QGIS to digitise features as well as best practices to ensure the features are accurately drawn.\n\nWhat is Digitising?\nDigitising is a term used in GIS for creating a vector data set that represents a real world feature. Vector data-sets are useful in that they allow the computer to easily calculate geometric attributes such as area or length.\n\n\nCreating a Layer\nOrdinarily, layers will already be created for you ready for digitising.\nIn this tutorial, however, we will create a Temporary Scratch Layer  for practicing.\nIn QGIS, navigate to Layer > Create Layer > New Temporary Scratch Layer… \nChange the Layer name and the Geometry type to the type of layer you would like to create.\n\n\nAdding Features\nTo begin digitising, click once on the layer you want to edit from the Layer Panel. A blue layer means it is selected.\nClick on the yellow pencil  on the Digitising Panel to Toggle Digitising Mode.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you are in digitising mode, the Add Feature icon will become available. Depending on the geometry type of the temporary vector layer you have created, this will look slightly different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd Feature Icon\nLayer geometry type\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint, MultiPoint\n\n\n\nLineString, MultiLineString\n\n\n\nPolygon, MultiPolygon\n\n\n\nTo digitise, left click to place a node. Move the mouse and left click again to add another node.\nIf you have made a mistake, press Backspace to remove the previous node.\nOnce you have finished the feature, right click to complete the geometry.\nSave Layer Edits  to commit the changes to the data source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapping\nThe QGIS Snapping tool can be used to create features that connect to each other, to increase the accuracy of edits.\nTo turn on snapping, navigate to Project > Snapping Options… > Enable Snapping (S) \nTurn on All Layers , Vertex .\nClick on the yellow pencil  on the Digitising Panel to Toggle Digitising Mode.\nHover over the vertices of the layer you would like to snap to. It should show a purple box.\nLeft click to begin snapping and adding to the Temporary Scratch Layer .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracing\nAccurately matching features such as site boundaries can be challenging.\nIt is tedious and time consuming to make sure you snap to every point on a feature and inevitably, you may end up with something looking like this:\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of gaps and the overlap between features are called ‘slivers’.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGaps and slivers must be avoided, as this may result in implications for calculating areas correctly.\n\n\nQGIS provides an excellent tracing tool which automatically snaps along the shortest path, ensuring that there are no overlaps or gaps.\nSelect Enable Snapping (S), click on Open Snapping Options and navigate to Advanced Configuration  in the Project Snapping Settings to turn snapping on for your desired layer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Enable Tracing (T) tool , Toggle Editing  and select the Add Polygon Feature (Ctrl+.)  to begin tracing the site boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you should have topologically correct boundaries:"

The Value box takes two parameters - the value you want to aggregate, and the aggregation function.\nIn this example, the value to be aggregated is Length, using the aggregation function Sum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can group the data by multiple fields, in the Rows or Columns boxes\n\n\nOnce you have setup the inputs to the GroupStats calculation, click Calculate to see the result:\n\n\nRestoration Example"
